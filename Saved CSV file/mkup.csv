Makeup,have chronic dry eye and love eyeshadow but everytime wear it my eye get so freaking dry and red it defeat the purpose of me even putting anything on my eye what eyeshadow do you recommend okay know not everyone is going to read this probably not one is going to read this whole thing but that not the point if you don want long story skip to the very last sentence like said love eyeshadow used to hate it because never knew how to blend always chose color that were unflattering or ugly color combination or just put it on way too dark wa horrible at eyeshadow and got so frustrated and always wiped it off then got better and better and finally learned how to actually wear eyeshadow and the right color fell in love with it used to dread it and like leaving my eyelid bear with some eyeliner and mascara but now can go without it miss wearing makeup so much eyeshadow is now my favorite part the problem is started randomly getting dry eye in january of and it never stopped so now month later still run into the same problem can put on any eyeshadow without it irritating the crap out of my already dry eye and making me want to rub them every minute they itch and they re really red when the eyeshadow is on and it just doesn look pretty at all it hell it never used to be that way before got dry eye so my question is is it at all possible to wear powder eyeshadow still look up something like eyeshadow for dry eye and get whole bunch of article that say the best eyeshadows for sensitive skin is that the same thing or are they talking about lid and lid irritation and not the eye moisture and eyeball themselves isn hypoallergenic makeup just for people with sensitive skin and allergic reaction with the eyelid and skin surrounding the eye or even on the face is there any option for people with dry eye so sorry for the long story what eyeshadow can you recommend for actual dry eye and not sensitive skin around the eye or eyelid
