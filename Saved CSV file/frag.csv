fragrance,what longevity do you expect from your perfume my perfume with the best longevity are bewitching yasmine by penhaligon and lost cherry by tf they will last until take shower or bath and sometimes beyond on the other hand my worst performing perfume are pomelo paradis and orange sanguine by atelier cologne after min might a well have forgotten to put on perfume that being said love both of them and will just spritz them throughout the day when want to wear them but don think will repurchase unfortunately what longevity do you expect from your perfume would say at minimum scent should last 4h on my skin else it bit of waste of money

fragrance,zaharoff signature pour homme noirhi gang just wanted to share mini review zaharoff is amazing stuff if you don want amazing fragrance just really good one what mean is they are niche quality but easy wearing medium sillage medium longevity not monster in strength or uniqueness so you could wear to the office date or just casual because everyone like the smell just not necessarily wow what stud you are for being different scent super well blended to the point that it hard to tell individual note and the ingredient smell really natural nothing obviously synthetic this go for both pour homme and noir have maybe bottle and say this is top for me so comparing the two is hard they are very similar signature pour homme had that lavendar in the middle that make it little more fresh and fougere like while noir had more wood and tonka so it little sweeter and darker think like the open of pour homme better because it brighter but after few hour noir ha slight edge maybe the wood and light oud is more forward then noir would be better choice for the under crowd that grew up on sweeter stuff because of the tonka whereas pour homme would have slight edge for daytime and over because of the lavender also these are definitely male but wearable by woman without worry particularly noir and particularly if you like little bit of leather glad own both though hardly need both anyway this is mini review comparison by random 40 male happy smell

fragrance,light hot weather option for skin that destroys blue fragrance ve recently gotten back into fragrance after pretty much forgetting that anything more complex than lip balm existed for the past nineteen month fairly confident in knowing what like and dislike but really struggling to find fragrance light enough to wear to work in hot weather college instructor and my classroom have minimal or no air conditioner on disturbingly regular basis so often teaching in degree temperature with little airflow if temperature were of no concern my preference lean toward sweet spicy and woody fragrance these are also the scent that are compatible with my skin chemistry for example ariana grande cloud might be regarded a fairly unisex fragrance but it lean very very sweet on my skin on my clothing it bit more neutral ve had indie perfume oil in the past that had citrus or ocean inspired note that worked very well but for the life of me can seem to find anything similar that work on my skin now female but will wear anything from sweet like candy to obsession for men so don pay ton of attention to the target gender of perfume ve tested several blue cologne in store that are just far too heavy sharp and overpowering nautica voyage is one example of this if remember correctly both the male and female version of cool water smell great in the bottle but both are much heavier on me to the extent that they don even smell like the same fragrance once they hit my skin going to experiment with spraying blue fragrance only on my clothing to see if can remove my skin chemistry from the equation altogether but wondered what other option were available most blue fragrance tend to smell very artificial to me anyway so cool water wa rare in that loved it in the bottle if not on my skin unfortunately the few other light fragrance ve tried such a elizabeth arden green tea perfume have seemed odd artificial and just not at all what wa expecting for others who lean toward sweeter scent what do you prefer in hot weather

fragrance,jo malone vetiver and golden vanilla may be one of the brand best yet for someone who doesn usually like the smell of vanilla in fragrance from finding it too sweet and cloying my mind wa blown the minute sampled jo malone vetiver and golden vanilla knew immediately this wa scent would be treating myself to one day this is not typical vanilla scent it earthy austere enveloping and enticing the two main note are very balanced the first sniff to me wa the earthy vetiver just like dried grass on warm day but the dry down wa mesmerizing it sharp smoky and ha delicious citrus kick the grapefruit is prominent without too much of sharp zing this scent is impactful and truly stand out from everything jo malone ha released over the year one of the best feature given the brand notoriety for bad lasting power is how well this scent lasted on the skin can still smell it hour later and is a delicious a ever it is strong and very sensual personally like this enough that probably wear it all year round but this win for the colder month one of the best ever from jo malone in my opinion if not the best across the board smell and performance

fragrance,juliette ha gun lili fantasy reviewi recently got my sample and the mail so here are my thought about the brand juliette ha gun is modern perfume brand created by romano ricci and is most known for their best seller not perfume they re notorious for their signature dna the ambroxan that can be found in the base of most of their perfume and make up most of not perfume personally their perfume have history of not working for me with the ambroxan coming across a chlorine on my skin and the perfume disappearing within an hour or so the scent jhag say an extravagant cocktail of white flowers and ambery note perverted with bubble gum gourmand twist an olfactory whirlwind that will announce your arrival and recall you after you re gone sounds fun the note breakdown is a follows top bubble gum accord heart jasmine and tuberose base ambery accord and ambroxan white florals aren usually my jam so the sole reason ordered sample is because never tried bubblegum in fragrance and because the sample wa cheap first of all this bubblegum is not sweet pink strawberry bubblegum lili fantasy open with an almost minty freshness leading to very clean white floral accord not unlike gucci bloom after little while some sweetness come through but this scent is absolutely not the kind of candy sweet that the name or bottle suggests jasmine and tuberose can be very heavy combination but don get any heaviness whatsoever it very light classic jhag the gourmand aspect that is mentioned in the description is basically undetectable but the amber in the base provides just little bit of warmth to the scent the wear time on this isn great ve never had great luck with light white florals nor jhag and this is also disappointing in the longevity aspect this scent reminds me of gucci bloom and jo malone wild bluebell meaning that it very light fresh and crowd pleasing white floral fragrance for me this isn fbw and while the minty gum is interesting prefer gucci bloom over this all in all had fun trying out this fragrance while the white florals were nice and clean the way like them and didn get any chlorine swimming pool don think this is anything special

fragrance,ambroxan question fresh or dank hello all still new to fragrance and trying to distinguish different note ambroxan is confusing to me because in various comment will read thing like the ambroxan give this fresh feel or the ambroxan keep it smelling fresh for long time but frangrantica note dictionary describes it a dry amber musky smell fwiw many sample or fragrance ve tried that are supposedly ambroxan heavy almost never smell fresh to me most of those do smell like some kind of shower gel marketed toward guy but ve never thought masculine shower gel ever smelled fresh except for maybe associate them with being fresh out of the shower that masculine smell though always reminded me of kinda burnt wood sap or like cinnamon clove sorta like old spice eros for example is not fresh to me beyond about second after spraying definitely not fresh like fresh air or fresh rainfall or cool and fresh and somehow reminds me of an old guy trying to be young something like the og acqua di gio or individuel are more of what would consider fresh guess to me fresh light so what up am off base am associating the wrong scent to the wrong note

fragrance,have strong projecting fragrance messed with my perception got bunch of sample in recently and wa testing them when realized that lot of my comment to some fragrance wa it smell nice but can barely smell it and this isn nose blind because this is immediately after spraying tests are always done spraying once on my arm wrist hand and getting real close to sniff then bit farther away for instance almost everyone ha smelled sauvage by now that stuff is beastly one or two spray and you can definitely smell it on yourself even many hour later versace eros felt the same adg profumo and spicebomb extreme are sort of in that category too from my experience funnily enough carolina herrera bad boy had some beastly longevity and decent projection on me and thought it smelled quite good especially a date night fragrance so wa surprised to see middling to negative review on it bottle design aside but recently tried for instance prada homme since it wa touted a great office fragrance and hey supposedly we re going back into the office soon sprayed it once and got real close to sniff literally couldn smell it mean did get little bit of soapy vibe but could barely register it similar with prada luna rossa carbon wa expecting it to be sauvage except le aggressive in term of smell but still similar projection nope could barely smell it soon after spraying as side note guess smelled the sauvage similarity in the drydown but the opening definitely did not give me sauvage vibe had similar reaction to like mont blanc legend barely smelled it shortly after applying guess wondering if the sauvages of the world have distorted my view of what good projection etc of fragrance is know this is subjective and know that you shouldn want people to smell you within mile radius but at the same time don want to purchase fragrance that literally if my nose wa inch away from my skin couldn smell it definitely want that sweet spot of being able to smell the fragrance at arm length away and or having nice sillage trail and feel that if can smell the fragrance inch away then there no way that you could smell it at arm length away or for it to leave nice sillage trail thoughts

fragrance,eight amp bob discovery set revieweight amp bob is french fragrance house whose origin story involves wunderkind french aristocrat mad science ing it in the family chateau for allagedly one john kennedy after chance encounter circa true or false who know but it fun tale nevertheless and sometimes that all want in any case had heard some favourable thing about eight amp bob original so purchased discovery set of six fragrance for approximately cad before tax price consider very reasonable the original if could describe eight amp bob in three word the first two would be classic and elegant and the third unmemorable mean that literally a genuinely cannot remember what this fragrance smell like until spray it again which is not usual issue for me eight amp bob is very crisp very appropriate it not fougere but there something about it that reminds me of clean shave and freshly ironed white shirt regardless the listed note are pink pepper cardamom lemon violet leaf labdanum died wood sandalwood vetiver and amber there virtually nothing in that list that distinct to my nose but eight amp bob doe smell good one imago middle aged man with impeccable manner and nothing to prove moderate projection moderate longevity at six to eight hour egypt when one think of egypt one think of spice and heat and sphinxes purring out riddle for ambitious young lad doomed to slay their own father and seduce their own mother egypt from eight amp bob is not that type of scent it listed note include lavender moss lemon cardamom nutmeg sandalwood leather and patchouli all of which blend together near seamlessly what egypt actually reminds me of is an endless procession of iconic designer fragrance everything from versace eros to chanel allure homme to guerlain homme ideal to ysl la nuit de homme et cetera all at once that doesn make it bad at all in fact it probably my favourite of the discovery set insofar a think it the best balanced and best blended and the final two third of it composition are genuinely quite intoxicating moderate projection slightly above average longevity at eight to ten hour cap antibes an unremarkable blue more business students association annual boat cruise than glamourous trip around the riviera cap antibes smell a with most blue like worse version of bleu de chanel mint violet leaf cedar and incense are all apparent and of course there the pale of vanilla in the base note for sweetness other note include birch cinnamon and moss cap antibes make me think of fanfiction written by someone who list scott fitzgerald and ernest hemingway among their favourite writer but ha never actually set foot outside of their own country before which is long winded way of saying that it nakedly aspirational that not always bad thing but let be real there are just so many better thing out there average projection slightly below average longevity at four to six hour memoires de mustique classic neroli and candied orange blossom scent with an amber base but also uniquely strong and sweet and cloying sillage other listed note petit grain jasmine sambac precious wood and white musk unfortunately memoires de mustique gave me mild headache within five minute of spraying so would strongly advise against it at the office or any closed environment really unless you like to suffocate your entire team at the risk of sounding completely unreasonable it conjures for me the image of dolore umbridge swanning around the hall of hogwarts in her pink and her frill cacophony of suppressed giggling and hem hem just sprayed it once again to write this review and already regret my choice strong projection more life than voldemort himself final rating of but know being ridiculous and it probably not actually that bad nuit de megeve crisp clean grapefruit over grassy vetiver base woven together by notable black coffee and stale tobacco a well a petit grain clove tonka bean orris and musk imagine byredo bal afrique minus the candied lemon and plus decently sized helping of bitter irony nuit de megeve is definitely the most niche of the fragrance in the eight amp bob discovery set insofar there no designer equivalent to it anywhere on the market and little interest in being likeable sadly for me nuit de megeve still feel like an unnecessary twist on bal afrique which consider to be byredo best fragrance and one of my personal favourite the bitterness make it interesting sure but clash with the profile otherwise projection is slightly below average ditto longevity at approximately four hour although an acrid aftertaste persists because although it not for me can certainly see smell it merit champs de provence the superior orange blossom to memoires de mustique with muted fruity opening of bergamot orange and pear although that bar is not high jasmine absolute and rose are also notable although lady in waiting to the orange blossom still and there distinct ambroxan trail that approximates addictiveness a well a an extra bit of zing with mate in the base note also musk absolute mostly champs de provence reminds me of designer woman fragrance although it is also unmistakably french in the way it conjures an aggressively powdery cloud around it wearer one image relatively young woman pretty but lacking self awareness above average projection and above average longevity at eight to ten hour a it just bit boring overall feel quite tepidly about eight amp bob discovery set but still find eight amp bob original egypt and nuit de megeves to be more than serviceable scent have zero desire to own anything from this house but if smelled any of those three on anybody else it probably be good time egypt in particular is quite sexy at least to my basic nose memoires de mustiques and champs de provence are both hard skip there are so many superior orange blossom scent out there and cap antibes may appeal to certain type of person but still try to sway them toward bleu de chanel or creed green irish tweed silver mountain water instead that being said the discovery set wa quite inexpensive so eight amp bob may be good house to try if you re hoping for fun pick me up for dreary day

fragrance,kouros amp batch amp batch http imgur com tjnhepo wa lucky to spot out the older packaging while surveying the ysl section of perfume vendor once got home hurriedly sprayed it on my skin yep kouros then compared the batch with my batch both batch smell like kouros obviously both have the dirty clean dichotomy going on but can definitely make out difference between the two formulation my batch of kouros smell bit more uplifting and casual sweaty rather than animalic make no mistake it is still quite unique and head turning among newer designer release but it certainly ha matured from it 80 identity a the premier cigarette piercing powerhouse it is revered a my batch of kouros however smell darker more of an oomph quite bit hairy and sweeter perhaps am making out the note of something animalic and honey can say for sure that older bottle of kouros have more richness in comparison to newer bottle has this made me vintage or bust kouros cultist though nah not at all an older formulation specifically pre will certainly give you richer perhaps even nostalgic experience and an animalic kick but newer bottle will still undoubtedly smell of kouros go about it according to your need

fragrance,review dior eau fraiche delicate slightly sour citrus and bitter green backed by light patchouli and oakmoss base that endears me with unexpected depth this is from but doesn smell dated to me and although it woman perfume it is easily unisex reviewing the current formulation and haven tried the vintage it wa made by edmond roudnitska who also did diorella and eau sauvage and this one land perfectly between the two not a outright perfumey a diorella and not a crisp austere a eau sauvage it ha full bodied and complex character even though it is on paper light and simple perfume he is able to bring rich life and character to it it mainly mandarin petitgrain and patchouli but by roudnitska hand you get something remarkable there are more note in play here people mention musk and vanilla but nothing overpowers so it hard to identify them individually an endearing quality enjoy in an abstract perfume that keep you coming back to investigate but never fully reveals itself there something in particular like about this one a opposed to another cologne or eau and that is the perfume aura reminiscent of diorella that prevents it from just being refreshing citrus or mild chypre the patchouli and oakmoss help ground the scent and give it some leg that make it similar to other edts in duration but it doesn dominate it remains light and gentle the sourness and herb prevent it from being too polished and give it tinge of grit that add depth though it never loses that soft perfume aspect and later settle to plush subtle slightly powdery glow with remaining echo of all the previous element really pleased with this one continuing my exploration of lighter simple scent that retain an artistic flair glad to have discovered such an old and relatively unknown one from dior the artistic tension here for me a with eau de guerlain is the simple made complex it keep me sniffing my arm a it never satisfies my curiosity for what actually going on in the scent think it expertly done

fragrance,penhaligon portraits scent library reviewi recently obtained the penhaligon portraits scent library which come in this positively delightful packaging http imgur com npd0ccf which will definitely keep after through with all the sample in question there quite an intriguing conceit behind this collection a well a described in the booklet gt what secret lie behind the good manner and closed door of the british aristocracy perhaps it time to find out so wait no longer do come in gt gt allow penhaligon to offer olfactory introduction into their not so civilised milieu by mean of ten of the family most notable character ve always loved the idea behind the portraits collection who doesn love good aristocratic soap opera after all but never had the chance to try it out for myself until now know lordzoot love penhaligon and ha done wonderfully in depth review of these portraits a well a the penhaligon range more generally so if you want more information and fun read check out his series as for me ve saved reading them for after offering my own thought a below the tragedy of lord george eminently strong severe even and masculine to start with healthy serving of vetiver rendered earthy but still smooth a fine scotch imagine logan roy atop his leather throne deceptively still fragrantica http www fragrantica com perfume penhaligon the tragedy of lord george html ha some nonsense about this one being spicy and sweet and many other reviewer completely disagree this is classic fougere with vetiver and lavender rendered quite sharp at first although it all softens after the first half hour into something almost cosy like tom wambsgans fisherman sweater moderate projection moderate longevity it fade to skin scent around the six hour mark for me not crowd pleaser but not terribly challenging either for me the revenge of lady blanche revenge they say is best served cold and cold is an apt descriptor for this chilly white floral scent there very little sweetness and no warmth the narcissus is sharp and although fragrantica http www fragrantica com perfume penhaligon the revenge of lady blanche html note iris suspect some orris root a well can help but imagine margaret thatcher on first date forced to wear scent and choosing the least offensive to her iron sensibility regardless have respect for lady blanche she very much in the same vein a chanel no classic if humourless beauty moderate projection below average longevity at under four hour another the coveted duchess rose straightforward rose with hint of candied violet edge truly don have much to say about this one a there are simply better straightforward rose out there notably penhaligon own elisabethan rose pity average projection longevity is about four to six hour on me much ado about the duke the superior rose compared to the duchess but honestly to my nose the worse version of le labo rose both are spicy and tad earthy although rose smell more natural and inviting while the duke perhaps it that gin note that conjures freshly cleaned kitchen for fragrance named after duke find this one smell like the handsome man downstairs instead average projection below average longevity on me at sub four hour a well the bewitching yasmine an easygoing aromatic oud with some floral touch for sure but difficult to pin otherwise wouldn have noted the coffee if it weren for fragrantica http www fragrantica com perfume penhaligon the bewitching yasmine html but reading it now that obvious the jasmine is rendered almost slightly bitter but balanced out by the sweetness of the vanilla feel like yasmine is almost excellent but the more smell it the more it feel like reproduction of famous portrait of some great beauty rather than the famous portrait itself let alone the great beauty average projection average longevity at four to six hour changing constance to me the most interesting of the lot with cardamom pimento and salted caramel http www fragrantica com perfume penhaligon changing constance html my first impression of this prior to reading the note wa that it smelled like tropical cocktail of sort and stand by that assessment still the pimento isn actually spicy but it doe give constance bit of lift the salted caramel is fairly restrained melting into vanilla and cashmeran get zero tobacco it make me think of malibu actually and young woman with unnaturally coloured hair and wide grin so can help it but smile sadly the projection and longevity are the worst of the lot so yet again the blazing mr sam if this bottle is the most popular of the portraits then can absolutely understand why it quite an addicting concoction and definitely representative of the spicy tobacco vanilla genre with plenty of patchouli and cinnamon a well one doe imagine gentlemanly bon vivant the booklet description of an american abroad with all the cocky confidence you might expect is perfect penhaligon ha really hit the nail on the head spritz it for wild night out full of good bad decision above average projection above average longevity at over eight hour a it just not my type of scent terrible teddy oof terrible indeed this is definitely fuccboi scent with load of ambroxan some spicy leather and smooth cedar drydown if chris pratt were fragrance or at least if starlord were fragrance think he be teddy you trust this guy with your dog maybe but not your best friend as far a leather forward fragrance from penhaligon go halfeti is superior but there is something undeniable and seductive about teddy regardless good projection and slightly above average longevity at eight to ten hour heartless helen straightforward tuberose not unlike the coveted duchess rose straightforward rose also one of the few inaptly named bottle in this collection a there nothing heartless feeling about this fragrance it just tuberose neither particularly fresh nor particular creamy and despite the fragrantica http www fragrantica com perfume penhaligon heartless helen html review also do not find this one particularly green although there is that brief blast of citrus in the opening average projection average longevity at four to six hour a feel penhaligon can and ought really do better the inimitable william penhaligon bright citrusy vetiver to open and swear smell something like gin in it so wonder if there unlisted juniper the sandalwood is also very prominent rendered powdery and there notable jasmine a well again tinge bitter but the incense and ambroxan bring back some warmth not sure how feel about william he feel like man of many face simultaneously old and young friendly to all but nobody ever really know him know even can tell whether he really gatsby or nick average projection and average longevity at four to six hour so ultimately have to be honest wa little let down by the portraits scent library but think it come down to matter of taste what loved wa how well each fragrance match the character it named after with the arguable exception of heartless helen there wa so much creativity and ingenuity that went into creating them can tell however did not personally fall in love with any of the fragrance themselves and suspect that just bad luck a the blazing mr sam and terrible teddy are probably the best of the lot but not my personal aesthetic at all regardless would still definitely encourage trying out this collection it really is massive fun and the packaging is among the best ve encountered plus so invested in the narrative behind these colourful character that remain on the hunt for sample of those that aren part of the scent library collection so that can continue the overall story
fragrance,my 19m curated collection so here it is http imgur com bovsjkc ve posted collection here twice before but both time ended up getting bored of most of the full bottle owned so sold all of them and decided to create minimalistic collection with three rule the fragrance itself must spark emotion if by the ending of the testing process didn absolutely adore it it wa removed from consideration it must adhere to minimalist aesthetic no garish bottle design it must fit it niche perfectly no redundant purchase this go for seasonal a well a significant note overlap set this rule for myself in order to create sort of spectrum effect moving from season to season seamlessly ended up testing out over fragrance so far these five have made the cut here are the review guerlain homme ideal cologne blanc homme ideal cologne is perhaps the fragrance that embodies the phrase joy in bottle more so than any other ve come across so far it open up with vibrant acidic grapefruit and later develops the signature almond accord consistent across the entire homme ideal line adding an almost bitter sort of creaminess to the scent it reminds me little bit of dior homme cologne but with more body and nuance homme ideal cologne is easily the least complex of the five but by no mean boring definitely worth try for the unique note combo and quality guerlain blending may be replaced by dior homme cologne serge lutens la fille de berlin layers to add some context before getting into the review ll say that haven ever been able to get along with rose a note the accord it complement the way most interpretation on the market are overly sweet and jammy and how little nuance most rose centric fragrance have just put me off that is until sampled lfdb this doe away with the traditional kind of scent profile associated with rose thick overpowering middle eastern often paired with saffron and or oud no lfdb is an austere ever evolving unmistakably european depiction of rose it must be experienced several time on skin in order to be fully understood it ll change and develop differently on different people and is incredibly complex on my skin get an almost deceptively simple dew soaked red rose right off the bat within minute it already morphing into much darker more vegetal fragrance reminiscent of bush of black rose on rain soaked forest floor then synthesis of the first two phase sweetness from the first green facet from the second finally it develops gourmandy creamy powdery edge almost like rose infused tonka bean or ice cream don think can confidently say ve completely figured the nuance of this one out it just that difficult to pin down urge anyone who want truly complex fragrance and is tired of the dime dozen oud rose combo to give lfdb try it challenging certainly but can be absolutely stunning on the right person and cap sniffing will not pas muster here testing on skin is an imperative may be replaced by ds and durga debaser dior homme intense paradox if had to pick one fragrance that smell most like me it would be dior homme intense the star of the show here are the earthy bordering on bitter iris and sweet woodsy cocoa on paper this may appear to be note mismatch in practice however they yield what is in my opinion the pinnacle of designer perfumery the contradiction within dhi carry on beyond the iris and cocoa it somehow simultaneously playful and formal youthful and mature masculine and feminine don consider it to be challenging but can see why many would feel that way it certainly far cry from the majority of mass marketed bestseller today an apt word to describe dhi is distinctive the perfect signature scent there nothing quite like it and not for lack of trying other house have tried time and again to make the dna their own though none have close to truly capturing the magic of dhi word of warning though the contradictory nature of this scent run perhaps little too deep the latest formulation of dior homme intense are not very well intense have pre reformulation bottle but those of you seeking something loud and strong look elsewhere or search for an older batch the original formulation that had prominent vanilla note a well a the reformulation are fairly potent though even my bottle isn nuclear by any mean may be replaced by maison christian dior feve delicieuse mangekyou on the surface this one may seem like basic overly sweet reference tonka scent give it time though and you may be surprised not sure if this is just down to my skin chemistry but get uniquely complex experience from feve to address the elephant in the room yes the dominant note here is tonka bean what make it interesting though is how the other prominent note seem to cycle through duet with the tonka in turn one minute get an almost fuzzy clean lavender tonka then cherry infused tonka after that perhaps chocolaty nuance to it or caramelised sugar like accord and so on feve is an ever changing kaleidoscope of tonka flavour each one transient and quickly replaced by another only to unexpectedly return at later time during the wearing a opposed to the discrete progression of la fille de berlin get most of the note listed in the pyramid this way barring the resin if they re actually present they re lost on me once again feve is to be experienced on skin don let the basic powdery scent on the atomiser fool you may be replaced by artisan parfumer noir exquis lalique ombre noire penumbra buying bottle of ombre noire wa perhaps the furthest bent the rule for any fragrance out of the collection didn test it very thoroughly at all in fact only sprayed it on skin twice before committing to full bottle it wa just that impressive what struck me first about on wa how dry and green the opening is not at all what wa expecting from what had assumed would be just another sweet tobacco fragrance with quirky note pyramid no the opening here is all about that fig leaf think philosykos esque leafiness but not milky within second detected sourness developing reminiscent of the almost fermented fruit accord to be found in something like guerlain homme ideal extreme or dior tobacolor the second phase of on consisted of the spicy masculine cognac and an astringent dry tobacco this isn your tobacco vanille or pure havane style tobacco this is unapologetically pungent and photorealistic actually quite close to the smell of cracking open pack of cigarette the mixture of spice and tobacco most closely brings to mind pdm herod though on is far far le sweet interestingly found that on never really lost the greenness or sourness of it opening it retained leafy herbaceous edge all the way to the end of it life though perhaps that could be another facet of the tobacco accord used here unfortunately on is difficult and expensive to find now and wa limited release to begin with for anyone looking for unqiue non gourmand take on tobacco though it absolutely worth it may be replaced by apple brandy by kilian say the collection isn quite finished yet ll probably be adding two more full bottle something green to slot in between homme ideal cologne and la fille de berlin and something to act a an all rounder of sort top candidate so far are nishane ambra calabria and pekji blacklight respectively oh yeah and ve got bottle of eros too because sometimes just want to smell like basic

fragrance,tom ford ombr leather v ombr leather parfumhey everyone hope you re all doing well happy friday this is just little review of another favourite tom ford of mine along with comparison to it new flanker tom ford ombr leather wa love at first sniff for me remember hearing about the new bottle design signature line per se and that is wa an original private blend have never smelt the original private blend version of ombr leather but the matte black bottle we all know today that an amazing leather scent very easy to wear fast forward year from and we now have parfum flanker of this beautiful scent ombr leather parfum bought 10ml travel sized sprayer from sephora ve purchased both from there but about year apart and happy to compare the two and choose which like better the bottle design of both these scent across all size are pretty much the same that beautiful matte black bottle and cap along with black label for the original edp and white label for the new parfum version ve sprayed these on forearm each ready to compare ombr leather edp widely acclaimed a being the more versatile leather fragrance of tom ford this fragrance open up heavy with leather and some type of floral jasmine believe is in this the fragrance alone is very beastly and even with just single spray it smell very amplified you get somewhat of spicy quality a well it smell very rich and earthy which all all give it very dark appeal there not whole lot more to add to this but a mentioned before many find this lot more wearable in comparison to say tuscan leather which is one of my many favourite tom ford fragrance and my favourite especially for leather scent that leather mixed with raspberry is just heavenly keep ombr leather to the colder month and season a that where it ll shine the most ombr leather parfum new release in all honesty this wa probably one of the last fragrance think of that tom ford would do flanker for but wa wrong the overall census is that this wa heavier more concentrated scent with main focus of it being more airy and green with note of violet leaf absolute leather cedar wood and green tobacco looking at the bottle you ll see it very similar to the original but with matte white label instead of black and of course indicating it parfum the opening of this scent ll admit took me for surprise it wa nothing like imagined it open slightly medicinal to my nose and not sure if that the use of the violet leaf absolute and green tobacco mingling and giving u that greener feel that we were expecting of course leather is very present in this and it definitely is heavy hitter but not quite like the original it hit hard but it feel like every note is competing to be dominant in this fragrance there is also orris in this fragrance but on it own not familiar what it smell like my girlfriend smelt the new parfum on me and said she immediately got tobacco and wish did because can smell whole lot of it once the fragrance settle you get this greener leather smell which is very nice and you start to detect the original dna and then it morphs into the original altogether leaving whisper of greenness and little bit of wood in trail of black leather coming back to my first comment have never thought we see parfum flanker for this scent it feel slightly redundant to have one but maybe there are those who feel differently would of liked this one to be bit more on the spicer side along with any tobacco they can shove in there that to me would of been amazing even dash of vanilla would be been lovely surprise do enjoy ombr leather parfum but would not stray to buy larger size bottle than what already own if had to choose one of these in the end it come back to the original the original is more distinctive and better suited for my taste of the colder month and season the parfum definitely ha potential to be worn in the spring and on not too hot summer day still pick tuscan leather any day but comparing ol and olp ol ha my vote thank you for reading as always feel free to let me know what you think of these and which of the two do you like more take care everyone http ibb co qnptvjj

fragrance,my impression of large sample haul part 1i like to give you all my impression of several sample recently bought these are the luckyscent 7ml sample vial dabbed them on paper to test without skin chemistry to mess with the scent zoologist chipmunk much sweeter and lighter than anticipated get dominant sweet note that sometimes reminds me of coconut much like replica jazz club behind that is an earthy leafy nutty scent that is what you expect from the name because of the note it like someone combined part of mmm autumn vibes and jazz club if you re looking for deep rich and cozy autumn scent this is probably too sweet and airy for you find it unisex possibly feminine until it dry down zoologist dragonfly believe this is new formulation it smell like you took beautiful spring pond after rain with all the flower vegetation and took away everything dirty its very vegetal green watery and natural it reminds me bit of lilac too this one lean feminine artisan parfumeur mechant loup lightly sweet licorice and honey at first its cozy yet brisk the anise note fade leaving it more of sweet earthy scent it doesn seem to last very long unfortunately enjoy it but my skin doe not unisex masque milano tango this one is potent and in your face get sticky syrupy spiced floral amber scent it feel heavy and dense like honeyed sweet potpourri and therefore think it lean mature and slightly feminine its beautiful scent but not my style masque milano russian tea potent black tea leather and mint there no sweetness here just crisp herbal punch backed by leather smells wonderfully natural clean and refreshing ll rate it unisex with masculine twinge masque milano mandala struggle to describe this one its soft herbal and nondescript to my nose meditative is an ok word to describe it forgettable is another unisex frapin opens with delicious blast of spiced boozy pineapple think an alcoholic spiced pineapple upside down cake unfortunately that pineapple top node fade instantly leaving it more boozy dried fruit with low projection love to own bottle if it performed better unfortunately spilled my sample on the floor whoopsie marc antoine barrois ganymede too many people kept recommending this one so had to get in on the hype its interesting for sure like opening new box of leather sneaker clean smooth leathery and rubbery are how describe it there strange familiar note from my childhood a well is it crayon or scented marker can remember and it bugging me now performance seems pretty good on this one though leans tad masculine but it light enough for anyone nobile la danza delle libellule what an absolute tongue twister of name it translates to the dance of the dragonflies in italian very evocative but the fragrance itself doesn evoke that imagery you get crisp red apple and cinnamon beautifully gourmand but you ll be left smelling like an apple cinnamon candle its up to you to decide if you want that leans feminine the house of oud dates delight yummy warm honeyed date with hint of tartness to balance it its very sweet cozy syrupy and uncomplicated rate it one of my favorite from this batch smells unisex to me by kilian gold knight powdery honey anise something about this one isn working for me though the note sound good on paper but feel bit strange in execution not bad but not for me unisex suppose by kilian black phantom feel like ve smelled this already xerjoff italica its not identical upon opening but it uncannily similar on the drydown get caramelly vibe with coffee background the coffee note fade too quickly however its yummy smell for sure but sitting here wishing it wa more potent and unique unisex drydown opening is tad more masculine shay amp blue salt caramel sticky salted caramel with popcorn certainly smell yummy and not overbearingly sweet don think want to smell like rolled in caramel corn however now your chance if you do unisex tuesdays over the chocolate shop dry dusty baking cacao with resinous woody backdrop its heavier and woodier than have liked but it certainly not bad just don expect it to smell like actual chocolate leans tad masculine due to that dusty wood note nishane fan your flames sweet boozy spiced pine needle not what expected for sure smells nice though if you thought jazz club wa too feminine or sweet this might be bit better for you it ha similar vibe leans masculine coqui coqui coco coco intense sweet coconut and some ylang ylang get strange floral rubbery note at first very beachy and happy but too unbalanced for me to wear its certainly feminine to me more to come at later date have large backlog of unreviewed sample thanks to fanofam for reminding me to review them

fragrance,the study of fragranceevening smell hunter ve been thinking about this for while a it an important part of fragrance for me other than simply smelling nice thing there part of me that want to explore the depth of perfume to smell every creation composition weird or wonderful to study them on paper on my skin over time and to compare them with each other to notice how my taste change naturally a grow older a well a how they change because of deeper understanding of fragrance whether that reading about the note reading review that enhances my appreciation or detecting something unexpected in something known and familiar it is this part of the hobby that find myself in tune with tonight and wanted to raise an internet glass to everyone here people who write review share what they ve bought ask question and participate in any way even the lurker as much a it seems ephemeral and intangible believe we are sharing in something beautiful meaningful and worthwhile cheers to u wa inspired to write this after reading this quote by edmond roudnitska gt to judge perfume is above all else matter of taste taste evolves under the influence of the environment but this fact must not prohibit judging the environment taste evolves chiefly with the acquisition of learning with the knowledge of fact and of aesthetic accomplishment which make it possible to analyze them and to provoke instructive comparison it is thus that each of u can progress along the road of beauty and of art to deny the usefulness of this training would be like refusing to admit that symphony is better appreciated after one ha studied music

fragrance,by rosie jane reviewi trying out the by rose jane sample pack and so far pleasantly surprised this is clean woman owned cruelty free vegan company with recycled packaging and no single use plastic the fragrance are available in edp spray and roll on oil will say none of these scent are particularly complex which is honestly part of the charm for me they are all very approachable and awesome for layering or wearing alone here are my thought on each in no particular order dylan open with big burst of earthy cedar as it settle it begin to smell like clean laundry and relaxing in the most lovely sauna notes cedar frankincense white musk lake is one of my favorite of the bunch it is so creamy and warm often sucker for vanilla so it is no surprise that love this it smell like napping with your lover or curling up in bed with good book so cozy and inviting it reminds me of something but can quite put my finger on it notes neroli sandalwood vanilla angie take me back to childhood where picking honey suckle that grows on the outskirt of our property and tasting it nectar something about it also reminds me of being on vacation floral fiend will love this notes honeysuckle jasmine fig rose is the lightest fragrance out of them all it really doe smell like your skin but better it is vaguely similar to amber by nemat very pleasant and soft notes nude musk sweet rose james is beautiful not usually into gardenia but particularly love this scent there is certain depth and richness to this scent and it layer wonderfully with lake notes gardenia amber fig marie reminds me lot of replica beach walk it smell like crashing wave salty skin and summer air like angie this one is very vacation esque both fragrance contain jasmine so that may be the culprit only wish the vanilla wa more present in this notes jasmine sea spray vanilla leila lou is very refreshing and juicy if sea foam green had scent it would be this fragrance it is basically springtime in bottle and it smell like the cool creative person that somehow always ha their life together notes pear jasmine fresh cut grass overall really impressed there is not one scent in this collection that dislike which can often say one thing appreciate about these scent is their for lack of better word simplicity can easily pick out each specific note in all of these even with them being very cohesive and well balanced think there is something here for everyone haven completely made up my mind but will likely purchase full bottle of lake

fragrance,eau sauvage summer citrusi have been on hunt for the perfect citrus forward fragrance something that doe well in high heat humidity tried the ateliers lv afternoon swim all of the creed best the xerjoffs etc while all of these were nice or very nice could not justify the price for weak longevity sadly kept overlooking this classic from am sure it not the same a it original formulation but it is beautiful in it current form the opening is all citrus lemon and bergamot with sweetness of lemongrass all of this then transition into mainly basil oakmoss and vetiver for the dry down the oakmoss is not too mature but give it such powerful base that extends it performance im sure would have thought this wa too mature few year ago but now appreciate it for me this is world better than dior homme cologne there is depth and complexity but somehow remains simply natural smelling absolute masterpiece at least in my eye

fragrance,it took me month but im in love with angel by mugleri ve been in and out of ulta several time and always end up sampling it then putting it down hated the smell and just didn get it even spraying it on my skin but people swear by it being amazing and something that grows on you wa never smelling the note it claimed and tbh it smelled gross to me even the guy working at ulta said you have to wear it several time before really getting it so actually ended up buying very good girl by carolina herrerra but when wore it out wa pretty pissed about the sillage and short span the smell wa gone in like half an hour so went to exchange and said fuck it let get angel don know if it the scent of actually owning it or what but wow it smell amazing and really doe transform the longer you wear it it will probably be my going out signature scent because the projection is crazy did the one spray in the store on my hand and my super sensitive nosed dad complained but he could smell where been in the house so definitely no overspraying will be done with this one lol

fragrance,luckyscent first impressions pdm kilian memo fragrance du bois etc ve done few of these review before and got big sample haul recently from lucky scent a haven tried anything new in quite while think overall it wa successful haul these are based off my first impression and skin test haven given all of them good wear yet but they ve all been tested good bit on the skin enough for me to know my thought here are my thought delina exclusif am not fan of this like regular delina alright and when initially tried this on test strip really liked the vanilla note in here thought it would be great but when tried it on my skin it turned so sour and sharp it gave me piercing headache on the plus the longevity and projection are both nice so if you like the scent no worry there delina la rosee my favorite of the delinas much fresher than the other two and doesn have that tart sour note in there that bother me if were to get one from the line think it be this one darcy didn think liked like but a ha been with most marlys it surprised me can definitely see the comparison to coco mademoiselle and miss dior but think it much better than both it very classy like dress up night out kind of fragrance but at the same time could work every day could see it a signature scent for sure it got good dose of patchouli but it well balanced so it doesn punch you in the face it ha just enough sweetness to balance it out would consider full size goldfield and banks silky woods oh my this is absolutely gorgeous very reach creamy vanilla wood scent without being overly heavy kind of reminds me of toned down more refined and complex version of elizabeth and james nirvana bourbon it hard to pick out note in here because it so well blended definitely gonna be one of my next purchase goldfield and banks pacific rock moss very fresh clean easy to wear great for every day summer scent in my opinion it lean bit masculine but it could be worn by anyone this isn really my style but it nice hiram green slowdive am completely and utterly repulsed by the opening of this fragrance ve been wanting to try it for long time cause heard good thing but that first sniff absolutely assaulted my nostril not sure what it is because love orange blossom neroli honey and everything else in here so thought it be win the dry down is bit better a it mellows out but there is something in here not fan of it very strong and not very pleasant in my opinion can respect what this fragrance is trying to do and it seems very high quality but it not for me unfortunately maybe will try again in cooler weather hiram green moon bloom super heavy tuberose not in good way like tuberose but this is like bouquet of tuberose on top of rotting corpse again like slowdive really turned off by the opening especially it not a heavy but it just got this undercurrent of something that my nose doesn like similarly to slowdive the dry down appears to be bit more mellow but just not fan hiram green lustre more pleasant than the other two not my favorite nothing special about it but it not bad it very fresh rose scent with some citrusy note hilde soliani sweet parmesan violet absolutely beautiful love good violet note more than anything and this scent is very simple candied violet fragrance high quality performance is nice it smell amazing on skin full bottle worthy most definitely bdk pas ce soir nearly identical to ralph lauren tender romance a ve heard people comment about that fragrance wa my very first fragrance purchase so it hold special place for me this is very very similar and very high quality love it and definitely think wear this lot in fall winter or maybe to bed nanadebary bronze not going to lie got sample of this just because thought the bottle wa cool the scent surprised me with how much liked it when first put it on it felt like very powdery iris scent with bit vanilla and it reminded me bit of shalimar but sweeter and spicier then got big waft of cinnamon it very present throughout the whole wear time afterwards it dry it settle into nice spicy vanilla scent reminds me lot of the holiday boththanksgiving and christmas it very lovely fall winter scent and the performance is nice also feel this could be unisex even though it marketed towards woman memo marfa really really enjoy this very sweet uplifting tuberose ylang orange blossom fragrance it start off little strong at first but once it calm down the dry down is very pleasant easy to like good for summer and definitely my style kilian liaisons dangereuses the most realistic dryer sheet fragrance ve ever tried no joke this smell exactly like dryer sheet fresh laundry get almost zero sweet note except for just in the opening just fresh laundry detergent and dryer sheet scent performance is nice will say would be good if you want to smell clean and freshly laundered although just doing your laundry would be much much cheaper kilian voulez vous couchez avec moi papillon angelique very subtle iris scent classy and elegant but too simple for me like powdery scent but prefer them to have little something sweet in there to balance them out and this doe not it all floral has similar dryer sheet type of smell like the kilian liaisons dangereuses performance not great it fade away pretty quick on me fragrance du bois petales de cashmere also very powdery but this one is more violet based which prefer to iris like this it doesn blow me away but it nice and ha good performance something would definitely need to be in the mood for but it nice kind of reminds me of lacoste femme which own and wear regularly this one is stronger and sharper though favorites are definitely silky woods sweet parmesan violet and marfa

fragrance,rook forest editiondescription forest edition by rook perfumes is fragrance for woman and men this is new fragrance forest edition wa launched in the nose behind this fragrance is nadeem crowe top note are pine tree and cypress middle note are black pepper cannabis and incense base note are cedar patchouli and white musk first impression got an instant visual with this felt like am hidden away deep inside forest filled with variety of tree and vegetation it spring day calm quiet and cool the sun shine through tall pine tree and gently warms my skin along with that sensation mist rise from the ground in response to the earth warming up am alone but not lonely it is quiet but welcome it a it is an escape from the constant hustle and buzz that we all face strong pine but need to make this clear a pine is note that am always on the fence about it not air freshener pine it softer fuzzy pine that provides comfort it doesn smell like generic christmas pine either which am grateful for this is rare fragrance in the fact that when read the listing of note could pick out and identify all of the note included wa able to notice the incense musk pepper cannabis although not terribly strong it there musk and cedar and cypress they all pair well and provide safe not dull not boring not generic but pleasing fragrance to wear really during any season this might read little more cold in the winter and radiate little more in the summer after few hour the pine becomes more mellow and left with wood and musk cedar and cypress are two woody note that have some difficulty with a well since they might cause an almost type effect ve encountered this before and can only nail it down to cypress being in fragrance and cedar can smell like furniture really quick if not done right this however doesn cause the effect and doesn give me that cedar closet feeling like some cedar note may sillage and longevity decent lasted around hour on my skin and clothing and got respectable amount of sillage this isn beastly fragrance and doesn demand attention but it may gather few compliment and would be appropriate for office wear would buy bottle possibly like to wear it again and see how it grows on me for fan of natural woody herby green scent you may really like this word to describe this fragrance solace serene calm

fragrance,aerin review cedar violet and mediterranean honeysuckle in bloomi am testing these after warm shower over light lotion spray each on my inner elbow for whatever reason mhib burned mildly for the first minute the other did not mediterranean honeysuckle in bloom via fragrantica top note are grapefruit and sicilian bergamot middle note are honeysuckle and tuberose base note are jasmine and honey upon first spray get ton of bergamot this back off over the next minute and let grapefruit take the lead it all grapefruit for while maybe just tad of honeysuckle around minute in the honeysuckle shine the tuberose isn really discernable it just sort of give some oomph to the honeysuckle at this stage it smell like big pile of honeysuckle on top of stack of dryer sheet on warm day have honey suckles in front of my apartment complex and laundry room right next door to my apartment it smell like the air but with romantic and slightly intensified twist projection is weak you get an intimate scent bubble your friend may notice stranger probably wouldn at normal stranger on the street distance anyways live in the us and people tend to give you at least three foot of space on the sidewalk at the one hour mark we still have decidedly honeysuckle scent just that and some warmth probably brought out from my skin wondering when the honey will arrive and then it doe another minute later but just barely at almost hour in is when get the first hint of jasmine it fresh not powdery jasmine flower hr in it project few inch the dry down is floral laundry sheet at the 5th hour it maintains this scent and performance this is lovely but uninteresting summer scent see nude blush pink color it feel like slow sunday off after long work week its pleasant it feel like enjoying the mundane not every fragrance ha to be the most extravagant unique thing you ve ever smelled this would be great for you if you want to try an aerin fragrance and you want something simple and light you can run the risk of feeling pretentious or overdone she humble low maintenance and pretty but she ha money to spend or she wouldn be buying aerin lol sure there more affordable alternative but if you have the money the bottle is gorgeous and it is quite nice don think it smell like something teen would wear probably at least somebody in their 20 and up there is no max age it could suit anybody think of young woman in simple linen sundress walking around town in the sunshine with nowhere to be she probably forgot to wear bra this is very work safe scent can imagine upsetting somebody with this cedar violet via parfumo top note are violet leaf and lily of the valley heart note are yellow gardenia and jasmine base note are amber and australian sandalwood and virginia cedar this project well at the start don smell any lily of the valley it doesn make it presence known but perhaps invisibly lift the scent little so it doesn feel too heavy get blast of wood and violet leaf the wood are bit ambiguous it stay the same for about minute at this point there more development on the skin the wood are now certainly cedar and sandalwood the sandalwood is loud but cedar is still noticeable there is something softening it and making it more feminine which must assume is yellow gardenia ve only encountered white gardenia in fragrance various take on white classic floral with varying degree of powderyness softness sharpness sweetness etc this one is lightly powdery and warm the amber hold everything together with touch of sweetness it good binding agent for the wood and florals the sweetness is at very pleasant level it not naive or juvenile sweetness at all just enough to keep it from being too dry or masculine at the one hour mark the cedar come out more the sandalwood is thinking about an irish goodbye the florals are still there the projection is le intense but it softly radiates around you another minute later the sandalwood figured out how to leave unnoticed now there ambery cedar think this is how it will stay until the fragrance ha run it course but wa wrong before the amber and cedar were singing duet but now amber is singing backup for cedar hr in it project few inch on the 5th hour it maintains the same scent and performance it would be more suited to an art or literature student few year into college or down to earth outdoorsy type who like to read and innocently flirt with stranger imagine this would appeal most to woman in their 30 and above but enjoying it at so what do know it hard to put an age on fragrance unless it extreme feel like this could smell delicious on man but it not masculine it unisex in the same sense a coffee break they smell nothing alike whatsoever but they have that in common very cozy or anybody whose chemistry it agrees with love waft of subtly sweet woodiness with my hug especially from somebody in soft scarf or sweater it great fall scent can see myself wearing it in couple month when it cool down if you like woody scent for every day it not too heavy to wear when warm but would not wear it when it hot it would shine in fall and winter for me sprayed this on my hoodie yesterday morning around 9am and can still smell it faintly very very faintly but it there it is currently 10pm wrap up surprised how quickly these scent developed wa hoping to get longer period of heart note and more time between the presentation of base note and the complete dry down scent the performance is very similar but cedar violet ha crazy projection the first hour ill follow up later in comment if anyone is interested in these scent after the fifth hour of wear

fragrance,reviews wtf am smelling including rex and bro scentssome people found my previous review helpful or funny so here are some more this set is not a indie heavy a the previous set of review wtf am smelling don know how to describe these too many word already on with review etat libre orange attaquer le soleil marquis de sade still can figure out how to even describe it get no funk but also no smoke or wood or medicinal smell it really rich but not sweet maybe like non sweet maple syrup or maple syrup with only of the sweetness some kind of rich sap but no green tree scent to it at all don even know wtf this is supposed to be but like it wtf even is cistus wtf is rockrose if honest it seems like made up plant the fact that have no idea what this is or what it even really smell like is beside the point this is on my list to buy full size of stereoplasm mirror image have absolutely no idea how to describe this really like it and it is my husband favorite on me out of all of the fragrance we own it kind of floral and also really clean but not in cleaning chemical and covering up smell kind of way clean in the sense that there ha never been anything around to smell bad and need to be covered up the floral is floral made from flower that don actually exist they just sort of willed themselves into existence out of nothing so that they could be distilled for this scent if you read the book or watched the movie under the skin this is pretty much what imagine that the main character would smell like so super hard to describe and little bit creepy in it beautiful oddity but really nice have ml bottle and ordered ml zoologist tyrannosaurus rex have no idea whether love this or hate it its just odd it is nothing like anything else have ever smelled and so feel like have no frame or reference to even describe it do not smell what other people say they smell no smoke leather etc based on the description read wa prepared for horrific stench but it wasn at all wa however still unprepared for the smell it an almost eye searingly intense smell kind of like mint but not fresh mint from the garden but distilled mint oil only the intensity of the mint is ramped up to and it doesn have the aroma of mint have ever smelled before is this laurel leaf have ever even smelled laurel leaf wtf is this scent am smelling wore rex the entire day but still have no idea what wa smelling going to try it again once it isn hotter than the center of the sun out and maybe will pick up more smell death and floral beware of the autumn people really want to like this but there is some note in it that is just weird to me and can figure out what it is smell similar thing in stereoplasm autumn people scent the only thing can figure out is it faint almost burnt plastic aside from that weird note this smell exactly like what think wonder wharf in bob burgers would smell like the ocean and carnival food so guess it is carnival scent only carnival built by mad max people that use plastic a fuel source stereoplasm the autumn people this is similar to beware of the autumn people to me there ha to be some note in autumn fragrances that smell weird to me it all can focus on am sure there are other note in here but can figure them out this is also one of the few stereoplasm scent that don love ariana grande god is woman on paper this smell like wet paper on my skin it smell like nothing if sniff it immediately after spray it on me it smell briefly like perfume alcohol then like nothing it pissed me off so much that there wa no scent that thought it wa joke bottle so clearly like the rational and responsible adult am bought it and brought it home and made my husband smell it initially he said wine maybe which is different than the potpourri you ll get ant or doctor office that he usually say everything that isn tom ford ombre leather smell like the only thing can guess is that whatever the hell this smell like it is similar enough to my skin smell that can smell it when put it on my skin husband said it pretty much smell like me but like had maybe had wine earlier so this smell like me with side of wine so there you have it but still have no idea what this is supposed to smell like me the bro fragrances if you think of the stereotype of dudebro that is kind of my personality but in the body of woman so if you are thinking someone that drive hummer chug monster energy drink give fist bump is overly obnoxious with your mom joke and is probably stock broker vice president of somethingboring personal trainer that me that bro only lady so ladybro or something my husband call me douchewife when am like this which find hilarious deconstructing eden mr right now ordered this entirely based on reading another review on reddit http www reddit com indiemakeupandmore comment nzsdig deconstructing _eden _made _me _smell _like _an _ahole couldn write anything to describe this better if you want to smell like an asshole in the best possible way you ll love this know do it not something will reach for every day and don know that need full size but will probably order the 5ml or 15ml paco rabanne million edt don give damm what anyone think love this even though the bottle is the most hideous monstrosity ever created it is at the top of my list to get full size bottle on me it is cinnamon rosey goodness with faint hint of smell me smell amazing let do jager bombs and am all about that combination am shocked to see that it ha mint in it because aside from the faint mint growing in the garden hate the smell of mint paco rabonee black xs really like this this is like million the cool weather edition it more spicy le floral version of the million edt will buy full size of this also if find good enough deal but if have to choose million edt win out ever so slightly over black xs mainly because feel like could wear million all the time while black xs is hint more cool weather dolce amp gabbana light blue for him it ha taken me week to even write anything about this it fine it smell good it not going to win you any award red carpet will not be rolled out attractive member of whatever you prefer will not throw themselves at your foot but also people will not scream what is that stench a you pas no one will be offended it ha that blue fragrance cool water sort of thing going on where it smell good but is wholly unremarkable you can disagree with me that fine don mind like have smelled dude today that are wearing essentially the same thing and the only time left my house wa to put gas in my car and get an energy drink what already said am ladybro did you not believe me we own bottle of this my husband and both wear it on occasion it large bottle so am certain it is lifetime supply so whether would or would not repurchase it doesn matter since don plan on living to be etat libre orange je suis un homme get bergamot and citrus don hate it but it also doesn smell like anything that different than

fragrance,review of autumn vibes by maison martin margiela replicahello all amp x200b not sure if this ha been posted but wanted to give review of autumn vibes by margiela replica because it is one of the fragrance release that wa most excited about for this season really enjoyed matcha meditation and because thought the premise of the fragrance sounded very interesting amp x200b the initial scent wa delightfully woody and bit damp in texture which is definitely what wa hoping for could smell the cedar and nutmeg and the overall impression wa definitely that of fall scent and with very similar smell to actual leaf it wasn overly musty but still earthy enough to be interesting amp x200b whereas thought the initial scent of matcha meditation wa saved by wearable dry down that wa still interesting thought that the autumn vibes wa bit too pedestrian after the initial spray think like bath and body works candle the note looked for were certainly there nutmeg cedar cardamom but the way they were arranged wa bit too spicy and flat making it smell more seasonal and le sophisticated if you like fall scent heavy in cinnamon clove etc you may actually like this a the projection and lasting power were definitely worth the price just overall found it to be bit plain after drying down compared to some of the replica especially after really expected more from the concept had read about definitely bit of let down for me but know plenty of fragrance enjoyer who will really like the scent and how long it last definitely worth the price point but not my cup of tea

fragrance,how bad would it be to put fragrance in the fridge trying to figure out how much liquid remain in completely opaque bottle if knew the weight of full bottle amp an empty bottle could figure thing out easily but don have those number so what thinking about doing is to put the fragrance in the fridge let it cool then bring it out to room temperature again just to clarify no other mean of heating will be involved the whole bottle will have condensation at first but the full part will stay cool for longer and continue to have droplet build up while the empty part will stop earlier than that as result ll be able to see exactly where the liquid level is after few minute ideally this should only require two gradual temperature change the cooldown from 75f 24c to 40f 4c and the reverse would this be too damaging for the fragrance or is this okay since there no high temperature involved

fragrance,reviews vinyls gourmands candies fruits and spicy leatherhere some review have more but figured should break these up bit so here are four loose category of review there are fair number of indie in the list because ve been on an indie kick lately the vinyls sexy cyborg scents have mentioned really like vinyl note in fragrance but the best one are those that are creamy or spicy vinyl most of the one below are really good thought about marking them a all 5 but bombshell and poseur are ever so slightly my favorite bombshell and poseur are different enough that feel like the both being 5 is fine deconstructing eden bombshell it creamy floral with really fantastic almost spicy vinyl know that doesn do it justice but really like it whatever it is that smell like spicy vinyl to me keep this from being look at me type of floral even with the name it doesn seem particularly feminine to me or even unisex more of sexy cyborg kind of vibe where you don even have time to care whether human notice you because you re doing many important cyborg thing ordered full size of this tereoplasm poseur this is creamy vinyl and pink cotton candy on me there is hint of something else but it indistinct a to what that something else is absolutely one of my favorite have ml but will probably order the 5ml soon need this in my life always this is insanely long lasting a skin scent can put it on and hour later can still smell it my clothes will have faint scent of it for day or so afterwards this is positive to me it might not be to you deconstructing eden cupids bow get mostly iris and creamy vinyl enjoyed the sample and wanted larger size but wasn sure it it wa different enough and whether would reach for it instead of bombshell to get full size so bought ml if didn know about bombshell would have bought full size of this without second thought haus of gloi narcosa this also ha creamy vinyl scent underlying the jasmine ylang ylang and tuberose love it in the hair oil it go well with florals and with anything else that ha vinyl smell to it really glad got this in hair oil so that didn have to choose between it and the others can layer in on with something else in the list or wear it with something floral win etat libre orange jasmine et cigarette thought would like this being that like jasmine and like the smell of cigarette what could possibly go wrong everything this smell like neither jasmine nor cigarette it smell like vinyl that is currently on fire and not the good smelling kind of vinyl either this vinyl is from and ha been hanging out in small space just marinating in all of it own vinyl fume want to like this really do and it make me mad that don but just no it get because it is still not a awful a combustible lemon gourmands stereoplasm enjoy your waffles didn expect to like this a much a did the description for this is spot on it smell like you are eating waffle with coffee and orange juice in your garden somehow the floral with food isn weird because the floral is pretty faint don know but like this stereoplasm humbug do you love spicy gingerbread that is this with bit of rum can wait to wear it in the winter time but it too much gingerbread for me when it degree outside haus of gloi who needs love get mostly coffee with hint of chocolate and fruit love this a hair oil to go with gourmand or rich spicy fragrance haus of gloi beguiled like this a hair oil it lovely tart lemon cake with bit of spice and raspberry hexennacht hellebore do you love pumpkin spice you will love this actually bought this one for my mom who loooooves all thing pumpkin spice but had to give it try from non pumpkin spice lover it not bad the candies fruits stereoplasm bloom amp pucker this smell like tart lemon candy that wa rolled in faintly strawberry flavored sugar while someone holding daiquiri watched it very tart but little bit sweet think lemonheads with bit of sugared strawberry the word still sound terrible but it amazing the first time we smelled it loved it and my husband said it smell like this is how you get ant but once wa wearing it he changed his mind and liked it also there is never wrong time to wear this love this so much want to marinate myself in it also have ml of this and will be ordering at least if not ml but want to rank it higher than that stereoplasm banilla cloud omg this is the perfect banana candy scent it smell like banana laffy taffy and love it as soon a this is available to purchase again getting another ml but want to rank it higher than that steroplasm banilla bomb sour cherry with hint of banana and vanilla enjoy this but not at the obsessive level of banilla cloud haus of gloi banana taffy where banilla cloud smell like banana laffy taffy banana taffy is boozy caramel banana taffy like this for lazy day around the house or in the evening after shower a something relaxing to put on hexennacht sucre bleu get mostly marshmallow caramel and sweet and sour candy with bit of cotton candy and popcorn in the background along with whiff of something salty maybe popcorn this seems somehow like more grown up candy type of scent think the popcorn help to take the edge off all of the sweetness pacifica tuscan blood orange like this it light and refreshing doesn last for age but it is cheap enough that really don care like the pacifica roller ball for tossing into my purse to have something to put on after getting out of the water at the beach or on day when want to wear several different fragrance sixteen peachy ing keen nice but just peach smell nothing that ha blown me away ll use up the rest of my sample but think have found better peach aqualina pink sugar eh this isn the worst thing have ever smelled but don love it it sweet but almost boringly sweet it smell like just cotton candy to me like sucre bleu for the same type of vibe but more interesting stuff going on with it or stereoplasm poseur for cotton candy vinyl sucrabeille combustible lemons wanted so badly to like this no wanted to love this wanted it to be my favorite thing ever the description wa something that my best friend and would have written my skin absorbs most lemon scent the one in bloom amp pucker being rare exception so wa not expecting to get much lemon from it and figured get ginger and pepper but oh my no my skin did not absorb it and it went to lemon pledge and gasoline only someone turned the fragrance volume up to it wa so strong that could taste it if wa on deserted island and this wa the only fragrance had would roll in dead fish before wore this the rich spicy incense leathery tom ford ombre leather this is my husband favorite to wear he can really describe it beyond saying smell amazing everyone else should feel lucky that allow them to smell me clearly he is also very humble it leathery but depending on who wear it it can go almost bit silicon and not in the creamy vinyl direction but actual silicon he give it bvlgari black this is such great rich rubbery sort of scent used up my previous full size bottle and need to buy another full size before it is ridiculously expensive difficult to find hexennacht bedford street really like this it ha coffee chocolate cherry tobacco leather and bit of fur smell maybe bit of candle smell it like sitting in your fancy library drinking coffee and eating chocolate covered cherry while smoking pipe and your dog nap next to you dig it but then ve always really liked that stuffy old personal library vibe and love the smell of pipe tobacco feel like should be wearing velvet smoking jacket or an evening gown while wearing it will likely repurchase this when finish up the dram that have but not sure what size will buy deconstructing eden the agony really like the chili pepper in this the chili pepper stick around but mellows out and then it good dark mix leather and amber with hint of vanilla it an interesting dark one but doesn seem at all foody haus of gloi risque mostly leather but with hint of rose like this a hair oil to go with leather fragrance or if want to add bit of leather to fragrance zoologist camel hmmm interesting it is absolutely full of spice need to wear this few more time to actually decide how feel about it it pleasant but not sure that love it etat libre orange spice must flow meh don hate it but not excited about it either it just solidly okay sixteen gothic lolita love it initially dry into just temple incense need to do full day test to get real opinion but honestly there are ton of other thing the are great and need to test also so we ll see if that retest

fragrance,sample set review lab on firei wa making an order of sample and ended up adding sample set from lab on fire apparently rebranding a what we do is secret kind of on whim heard of the brand in passing and while the very la branding doesn really appeal to me they ve worked with some pretty big name perfumer maurice roucel dominique ropion etc longevity sillage not someone who is generally that concerned with sillage or longevity of perfume though prefer something softer to something that project widely tested all of these with single spray on the wrist in weather that wa quite hot and humid none of them had amazing lasting power nor were they particularly strong messy sexy just rolled out of bed crowd pleasing creamy vanilla it well balanced not too warm not too sweet but fairly linear and one note on me hallucinogenic pearl this is an interesting one mostly get soft comforting suede leather with some orris coming through and very light lipstick smell which imagine is the violet note like walking into luxury vintage shop what we do in paris is secret these name are killing me opening is bit fruity the lychee suppose though it not quite spot on and is almost bit sickly to me after that mostly get vanilla amber wa surprised to see dominique ropion the nose behind malle carnal flower and portrait of lady wa behind this one though suppose he doe plenty of more commercial perfume too it fine but quite boring made in heaven the style of this perfume is listed on their website a carnal innocent which is just cringe again not fan of the branding the perfume itself is also strangely orange but let get to the fragrance it well balanced jasmine not a indolic and sexy a something like lush lust it fresher and lighter and tempered by slightly sweet milky base smells like cereal milk on drydown hossegar the fragrantica page describes this a gypsoul in the copy word that ha thankfully been removed from the website cool sea breeze on forested shoreline it surprisingly fresh for this kind of scent which can often get heavy with brinyness or wood note it becomes considerably le interesting upon drydown where everything kind of flattens out into generic men blue aquatic cologne vibe liquidnight hinoki with bit of incense the vanilla note isn prominent in this one to me it lends more of soft warmth and sweetness with bit of cool dry herbal note from the clary sage like hossegar credit to liquidnight is that it doesn feel heavy or muggy the way lot of hinoki fragrance can even on hot summer day california snow get cool herbal almost minty scent not so much fresh mint a mint toothpaste after drydown it standard slightly woody musk this had very short lasting power on me couldn smell it at all after hour of wear my own private teahupo so teahupo is apparently surfing destination in tahiti and the brand description of this is very much a salty oceaninc fragrance don get that at all from this mostly get kind of synthetic smelling amber and not much else overall these fragrance were inoffensive but more generic than expected combined with the branding they feel very la girl too cool for designer fragrance but ultimately still basic hallucinogenic pearl wa the most interesting of the bunch and ll happily use up my sample of made in heaven and messy sexy enjoy sampling fragrance and don regret purchasing the sample pack but none of these are full bottle worthy to me
fragrance,is notino uk trustworthy ve been eyeing up few montales for while which retail for on selfridges and harrod however on notino uk website they are being sold from for 100ml bottle it just seems too good to be true ve never ordered perfume from them before so skeptical do you have any experience with montales from notino uk and can you confirm their authenticity

fragrance,popular unpopular opinions only participate in fragrance when it come to fragrance discussion am not on any facebook group rarely watch youtube rarely read fragrantica or basenotes and have no friend who are into fragrance so this is my only fragrance community every three to four week there is an unpopular opinion thread concerning fragrance most of the time when read the thread and post come to the conclusion that the fragrance community of these other place must be way different than here or else people aren reading the same post that am in fact find that people put forth extremely popular opinion on fragrance a being unpopular so here are three unpopular opinion that are actually popular on fragrance creed parfums de marly tom ford and br are overrated the claim these popular fragrance are product of hype too expensive not good etc the reality the vast majority of fragrance discussion on these fragrance are negative in particular creed and parfums de marly get ton of negative post and comment tom ford and br are more of mixed bag with some commentator loving them and others being negative positive post concerning these fragrance are rare on fragrance the only evidence to support the claim that these brand are overhyped by fragrance could be that by sorting by new many dead thread concern question about these fragrance or that these fragrance do often appear in collection post taken a whole don find that these fragrance are hyped by fragrance user and in fact if you only consume fragrance think you would likely come across with negative view of these fragrance and brand rather than positive one fragrances shouldn be confined to season gender age etc the claim this unpopular opinion state that fragrance shouldn be confined to season gender or age too much pressure is being put on people to wear specific scent the reality wear what you want this might a well be the tagline for the subreddit fragrance user overwhelmingly support the idea that you should wear what you want when you want and all other consideration to outsider be damned in any thread asking for advice concerning season age gender etc the number one comment will always be echoing the idea that you should wear what you want actually quite like having seasonal fragrance it fun for me to try to find scent that remind me of each season feel like my view is an extreme minority when seasonal discussion come up if season gender or age consideration are being pushed upon people it most certainly not done by this forum is too expensive the claim the brand or fragrance is too expensive and not worth it the reality have found that the popular consensus on fragrance is that fragrance are not worth it in sense that people do not hype up the cost quality narrative in general expensive fragrance get the most negative attention on fragrance most fragrance user seem to put forth the idea that worth it is personal taste preference matter only and that brand or individual fragrance are not worth it for everyone also who is going to argue you with that something should be cheaper

fragrance,lab on fire sample reivews general thoughts found the house to be very approachable in it fragrance blend like their pr write ups and their naming convention not so fond of the bottle shape don think ll ever personally buy fb from them but it wa fun to try multiple scent from the same house don often get that chance did find it interesting how in blurb they say each fragrance is designed by famous nose inferring that each fragrance is going to be wholly different from each other but found all of the scent to be fairly consistant in tone staying in line with the branding maybe it just the one got after all there other one haven tried they mostly sell 50ml bottle for 125usd which is pretty up there considering but checked their website and they definitely have vibe their trying to sell so for me that account for why the pricing is what it is messy sexy just rolled out of bed edp notes bergamot peach blossom rose heliotrope musk toffee amber white wood vanilla tonka bean soft creamy nutty almondy note with that cashmere tone don know if that real descriptor can see someone really loving it for sweater weather or for lounging at home not for me personally when smell it picture something who drink lot of green smoothy and love wearing expensive ripped jean with slouchy sweater and owns small dog and big house paris edp notes key lime ginger cola accord neroli petal coriander seed thyme macaron accord amber musk hits that sweet spot that like spiced floral herbaceous without being too peppery and light without being too soft and flowery don smell the key lime at all but the ginger is great and keep the whole thing bright energized don smell cola either but that might be the spice mixing with the coriander and thyme those spice keep the amber and musk from making it too rich and heavy though found it to be great unisex edp option wear it in summer and fall what we do in paris is secret edp notes bergamot honey lychee turkish rose essence tonka bean vanilla heliotrope tolu sandalwood ambergris musk can say ever smelled the bergamot honey or lychee and have no clue what tolu is smells like sharper version to messy sexy just rolled out of bed msjrob which maybe come from the sandalwood and ambergris say if msjrob is the round version this is the square version to the same dna style of scent it doe last several hour could smell it on my shirt after the whole day very likeable and could be first step towards the lesser known house for someone coming from the main market of big name designer cologne freckled and beautiful edp notes orange flower neroli honeysuckle warm milk pastry salicylate sandalwood vanilla bean heliotrope the pr write up state floral gourmand and would agree first smell get almondy fruity pastry develops into the floral bouquet with the vanillic tone after vanillic in the sense of how we can smell vanilla extract and think sweet but then we taste it and it not very soft and unintimidating if you like gourmand this is one reccommend checking out

fragrance,new cdnim and general fragrance strength question hello ve been doing some reading on this fragrance lately and thought give it try realize there might be lot of thread on it but wanted to compare if my experience with it strength ha been normal since fairly new to fragrance collecting and have had mixed experience so far just got the 200ml edp bottle in the mail today and the impression wa that the spray seems sorta watery and diluted in the past ve smelled some very potent single spritz that come off strong and solid like eros layton etc like the oil of the perfume hit almost how pure essential oil would ve also had some scent come on quite strong and rich but evaporate into nothing over an hour or two unless multi spray like adp essenza heard people describe cdnim a having strong initial scent and the scent definitely lingers on the arm for bit coming off a nice lemon pineapple with bit of smoke but it feel diluted and watery without any real punch compared to some description a brick wall of pineapple acrid lemon pledge etc im not getting anywhere near that essential oil kind of strength in the scent is that normal for other fragrance a well the atomizer seemed to work fine on first spray too is it true that atomizer should be kind of poor on first spritz or can they come out working right off the bat reading through the comment on some other thread give me the impression that batch variation are pretty controversial but wondering if this is actually the case its french batch so debating whether it just rotten bottle or this is the average expectation for this style of synthetic frag and batch code are b any input is much appreciated thanks

fragrance,my take on some jo malone scent elegant bottle minimalistic but beautiful scent not a complex a other brand and all the scent are good for layering find most of them can be worn all year round and are mostly unoffensive but impactful enough for people to notice if you like scent on the line of simplicity jo malone is worth look all mainly unisex a well which is bonus here is my take on some of the scent from the range vetiver and golden vanilla smoky and enticing an absolutely amazing vanilla scent the vetiver is pronounced like dried grass think this is one of the best vanilla scent one can find the vanilla isn aggressively prominent or sweet an absolutely beautiful balance of the two note this is mysterious and an absolutely ideal winter scent very enveloping for cold weather blackberry and bay lovely fruity scent nice for any time of the year prefer the candle version personally very tart fresh blackberry juice to the point that it smell alcoholic neither love nor hate it pleasant but have other preference basil and neroli delicious and unique very italian meditteranean vibe get the neroli lot more than the basil personally very like something you find from the acqua di parma line myrrh and tonka beautiful real stand out and still holding spot in popularity from the brand not for everyone if you don like heady scent smooth and dark lavender is pronounced but not aggressively beautiful balance of the note in some way this is very like vetiver and golden vanilla if you like one you will like the other english pear and freesia beautiful but like blackberry and bay think would prefer the candle version winner for fruity scent lover the pear is very pronounced same take a blackberry and bay for me mimosa and cardamom so so unique and smell very strange if you like something different this one is winner like it more and more with every wear spicy but creamy wild fig and cassis love this but am biased because really like the smell of fig in general which is the more pronounced note in this scent very very prominent on the woody side of scent and smell earthy and like wet grass on the first sniff wood sage and sea salt jo malone is not known for great performance and this one for me is the prime example smells amazing nonetheless and is firm favorite of mine salty clean and musk think of violent cliff edge with the wave banging peony and blush suede really lovely floral scent get lot of apple on the dry down it smell very pink and feminine but sexy personally prefer the candle version this is fantastic scent but to me is better suited in candle white moss and snowdrop one of my favorite and disappointed they only had it for christmas limited edition not for everyone but smell fantastic to me the first sniff is powder on the skin smell clean soft and clear cut think of some sort of socialite in georgian london wearing fur coat without being pretentious wild bluebell lovely floral scent dewy and pleasant not my favorite but is still very nice and make for excellent layering like most of the scent like it with mimosa and cardamom the floral kick is beautiful this one to me fall into the prime example of minimalism it is very simple amber and lavender think of very luxurious italian barber this is extremely unisex and not everyone will like it love it personally it smell very indulgent is very strong and they manage to balance the lavender with the amber very well the latter becomes very prominent on dry down deep and clean english oak and redcurrant bring this back smelt addictive and wa such stand out unique spicy and smell like autumn the brand ha lot of other scent but these are the one ve had experience with mainly and interested to hear your thought whether it these or the other scent

fragrance,celui de jean dessèspics imgur http imgur com esws6ps jpg and imgur http imgur com femx2q jpg ok this is vintage rarity from my collection in the biggest bottle own it doe not have the ml on the bottle sorry but put the coffee mug in the picture to give you some idea how large it is backstory once read this great article in vogue by joan juliet buck called fragrances remembered iirc which wa great piece of writing for perfume nut but one ve never since been able to find again she spoke of several perfume in this article but this one intrigued me so much a had never come across it in my life and she said it made waiter chase after her a it wa so alluring also people would ask her what she wa wearing and she would answer celui de jean dessès but a that translates to the one of jean dessès they would then ask which one and so on it didn have listing on fragrantica when first searched few year ago but it doe now it wa allegedly introduced in but the advert have seen for it look to be from the 1960s and 1970s which suspect is the era of this particular bottle fragrantica list it chypre floral but iirc the harmann amp rheimer chart ha it a leather chypre again iirc and to me it quite leathery anyway love chypres in general and this one is super dry to my nose could easily be unisex imo love dry a it getting more unusual these day given the craze for gourmand and so on to me it fairly woody a well a the leather chypre note and ha herbal touch in there of some kind in memory of the article mentioned searched for this on ebay in about and wa delighted to find it it came very far to me from the usa to new zealand this massive bottle it wa fuller then and happily intact and leak free the bottle is actually really beautiful but it is always hidden away on my dark shelf a it never had box when got it wore it out the just other night but ala nobody chased me it doe smell kind of old but in really good way

fragrance,ghastly git decant from fragrancenet an aberration background recently revisited few creeds at my local nordstrom it been year since ve smelled git but it generally agreeable to me in that cool water ish way well this nordstrom tester wa rapturous whoa haven been so impressed with fragrance since my first whiff of millesime imperial the employee made me sample from the tester and just can get enough of it it cm3220001n in the black bottle get gorgeous lemon and violet saltiness and touch of mint all resting on that intoxicating buttery creed base the depth and richness are unbelievable this is heaven the scoop not ready to dive into full bottle ordered git decant from fragrancenet ve had good experience with the site but the juice received smell beyond awful harsh cleaning agent settle into some urine geriatric accord it smell like public toilet the bad note are funky and the familiar note that love are nowhere to be found this is mess and if this juice is out in the wild it might explain the few review that complain of git having an old man smell are any batch known to be a bad a describing or is it more likely that the decant came from spoiled bottle it so offensive that it seems beyond batch variation also my nordstrom sample is still amazing ll probably buy from that store since they ve been really good to me ll have more confidence or an easy return if end up with funky bottle it going right back no way keeping green irish pee to see if it macerates by

fragrance,summertime samples reviewi currently don have any true summery scent in my collection so thought give few try do have bottle of costa azzurra but really not sure how describe it ve tried to give each of these good wear and run over the last two month millesime imperial so aquatic and mineralic something fruity in here a well although not sure what that is as is with most creed everything is just thrown in the blender but it doe come out smelling quite good virgin island water laying on sandy beach on an island in the caribbean drinking coconut water and eating fresh fruit this one is delicious but bit nauseating chinotto di liguira this for me wa the overall winner of the group dry citrus atop creamy and herbaceous flower paint the landscape of the northern italian coastline longing for summer that never end carefree body and mind full of good drink and better food mandarino di amalfi fresh and beautiful citrus over aquatic florals unfortunately mr ford is laying more poolside than oceanside mandorlo di sicilia sweet and sensual my second favorite of the adp warm vanilla and almond atop rootbeer float the woman in my life love it equipage this is what men used to smell like and imagine wa constructed in the to be like what men used to smell like the remembrance of grandfather father men in suit in boardroom or gentleman club reminiscing on war and discussing the division of continent makes you wonder why we don go back until you re reminded that it just fantasy of someone else idyllic memory of time that never existed adp intenza this is what italian men used to smell like worn not by gianni agnelli but perhaps by one of his executive adp essenza younger better looking and more chiseled jawline bit of sprezzatura for the original and intenza un jardin sur le nil this smell like my mother garden compliment but not so sure that this is something would like to smell like more something would like to smell walking out on terrace in the late summer there are few fragrance that can so masterfully construct memory of moment un jardin mediterranee this is what the mediterranean really smell like at least some part of it just not one ve ever been to maybe off the north african coast or in spain or one of the many island unfortunately there something in here that find rather off putting if were to smell this on another person be more intrigued by curiosity than would be interested arancia di capri read review of another fragrance where someone said you be better off putting an orange peel in some alcohol and spraying it on your body if were to squeeze orange juice and spray it on myself imagine this is what would smell like maybe just better off doing that neroli portifino quite like this think it would be an incredible shaving soap vetiver not huge fan of this one if this is what the men were subjected to while shopping at guerlain before habit rouge or if they weren stealing their wife perfume not sure why they would ever return fico di amalfi imagine this is what most people think of when they dream of the italian coastline inspired by fellini film and postwar postcard however like american tourist to the people of campania the longer this is around the more annoying it get cipresso di toscana the least blue of the mediterraneo line it still summer so really don feel like putting this on so not sure how to rate it

fragrance,sotd friday august 13th 2021happy friday everyone decided to finish out the work week with another from di ser today went with sola http www fragrantica com perfume di ser sola html it open with very vibrant uplifting even yuzu and lemongrass the creamy lavender soon show up and then it shortly joined by florals credited a geranium jasmine and magnolia but not always the best at picking out specific florals outside of rose and jasmine the base is very soothing and grounding combination of frankincense and myrrh this is another great release from one of my favorite house as with everything from di ser and the majority of all natural it not going to be huge performer this is something ve kind of come to enjoy though it feel like more of personal intimate experience that is first and foremost for yourself which is how ve come to view perfume in general what everyone else wearing today

fragrance,differing performance from decants to official sample since only recently started exploring niche fragrance ve been sampling around different unofficial decants in the last few week in hope of finding one or several perfume that blow me away and aren a disappointing a the one used in the past in term of performance and sillage ve settled on few that really surprised me and decided to sample them again before buying but this time from the perfumer themselves and unfortunately disappointed because everything suddenly just seem to be completely off in particular br extrait and louis vuitton ombre nomade both seem much weaker and aren holding on to my skin nearly a long a the decants used week prior and have hard time splashing out money for the full bottle if the performance really seems that weak to put it in number the decants for both used to last on me all day long could even smell them the next morning while the original sample last for maybe hour on my skin ve read that new bottle might need few week after opening until they develop their full performance but doe this also apply to sample also could it just be that the decants have had different atomizer that spray much more liquid per spray than the official sample or am just getting crazy

fragrance,what ha surprised you the most about fragrance what misconception did you have about fragrance in the past and how have they changed a you ve tried and worn them more ve been most surprised by how picky am many fragrance lover can pick top and wear something different every day meanwhile of the fragrance sample are unwearable they can be amazing on first spray and pleasant on someone else but there always something in them dislike and that dislike grows to be migraine inducing cloying or annoying with hour of constant exposure do have favorite that haven ganged up on me yet yet ve also realized that there is no such thing a fragrance that everyone like even top rated crowd pleaser like layton or aventus can be downright repulsive and migraine inducing to some people br get way too much hype a crowd pleaser for how many people think it weird dentist iodine or even body odor so go easy on the spray let the few who hate it move away and those who love it to get closer lastly ve been surprised by how little finnish people care about fragrance most often wear clone of aventus and nobody who complimented it so far had smelled or heard of it before neither had boring and overused in some place for sure but here it seems to be pretty unique probably help that rarely smell anyone casually wearing any fragrance used to be totally oblivious to them a well before my sister got one really liked now wear something even if don leave the house all day

fragrance,what are your unusual gourmand fragrance ve always loved gourmand don tend to wear them much but they re one of my favourite thing to smell enjoy them much like dessert in moderation a pick me up or sneaky treat here and there but there are number of perfume that consider gourmand because of my cultural background when the majority of the fragrance community would likely disagree with my assessment and probably vehemently so for example musk is flavouring in australia one that used quite often in lolly and dessert musk stick http en wikipedia org wiki musk_stick are staple of kid birthday party and you can even buy musk flavouring to use in baking ve got some use it in icing it great fragrance like marshmallow by mor http www fragrantica com perfume mor marshmallow html is pink musk stick in bag for me but reading the review there clear divide between people who ve grown up it a a flavour and those who haven give me any clean rose musk type of fragrance and ll start feeling hungry but for the majority of the fragrance world that not going to be the case probably le common but even thing like sandalwood can be edible the tree grows nut you can buy them in health food store http thesandalwoodnutcompany com what are sandalwood nut they taste great but they also taste like sandalwood and that not normally seen a an gourmand on it own so reddit curious if these are my unusual gourmand what are yours what are the fragrance that make you feel hungry that someone outside of your cultural background might not understand the weirder the better
